# Do Great at Working Remotely
#career, #beginners, #productivity, #remote

Due to recent world events, I was called on by my family to set them up to work remotely. In this post, I want to share what I've learned by working remotely (and leading distributed teams) over the years. These tips will keep you productive, effective, and above all, balanced.

## Before You Arrive at Work

Here are the essential tips right before you head "into work."

**Keep your routine.** Just as if you are going to work, keep your routine the same. Eat breakfast as you would. Shower and dress the part. Signal that you are ready to begin your ritual of working. In fact, by placing on "the uniform," it improves concentration and pride in work.  

**Walk to work.** Now without commuting, your stress will be reduced. However, it will be hard to discern the boundaries of work and personal life. So in the absence of the commute, go out for a walk as if you are traveling to work. The action will set the mood as if you are arriving at the office. Benefits can compound for your [health and mind](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-manager-stew-dd59cd653728), especially if you listen to focused podcasts during that walk.

## While You Work

Once you arrive at your home, here is what is essential "while you work."

**A separate place in the home.** Having a different space in the house is vital as a dedicated place to work. Preferably a room with a door is best. However, this is a luxury for many. So carve an area that is work only.

**Equipment does matter.** Having a fast computer and a reliable internet connection is vital. And the accessories are also crucial. Having noise-canceling headphones helps to reduce distractions. For those that want to go further, a separate boom stand and professional mic to improve the presence of audio-video conferences can be amazing.

**Standing up is essential.** There is a reason why, in the software industry, standup desks are pedantic. They do matter. While many do not have one at home, it may be a good investment. Regardless, as you work, it is essential to switch between sitting down and standing up during the day. Do this frequently, just as you would at work.

**For all meetings, video always on.** Now that you are at home, it is imperative to cue into the human side of working. As much as you can do, keep the video on for all meetings. Smile, and be social. We all desire this connection. Facial expressions do build trust.

**Be intentional to communicate effectively.** The most prominent benefit of remote working is the periods where one can be very productive. In software, we enter [deep work](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/12/19/cultivate-the-skill-of-undivided-attention-or-deep-work/), and it's lovely. However, we must balance this with intentionality. Actively reaching out to others on the right channels is essential. Whether it's for the team, a followup, or your role demands it, do it well.

**Active followup in minutes, not hours.** The contract above goes both ways. For those that seek you, be sure to answer incoming messages in a timely matter intentionally. If you cannot actively engage, state this and a time that you will be available for the query or chat. Swift acknowledgment is critical for all incoming team messages.

**Take lunch.** It is essential to step away from your desk during lunchtime. Take the time to decompress. Go out and get fresh air, too. As a nice side effect, your lunches be cheaper, but also healthier since you have groceries at home.

## Work with Your Team Well

As you work, apart from the tips above, you can work "well with the team."

**Intentionally build team culture.** Team building is essential, and there are plenty of ways to gather remotely. You can take the lead! Your teammates want to know about you. Set up a time for regular socializing, online happy hours, and brainstorming sessions. Do it frequently and invite everyone.

**Make artifacts easily discoverable.** With remote work, hallway conversations happen less frequently. Keeping a central place of knowledge (such as a wiki) is critical to organize artifacts such as documents and design docs. Importantly, be proactively transparent on your progress in tools the team uses.

**A persistent video hangout may help.** For those teams that actively require collaboration, having a centrally located video chat open during working hours can work well. Anyone can bring forward a topic and actively discuss it. Virtually tapping on other's shoulders is possible with this setup.

**The ability to flex with timezones.** Distributed teams span across the world. Remotely working from home can have the benefit of flexing hours to accommodate active contribution and being present at team rituals.

**Regularly meeting in person is paramount.** We are storytelling humans, after all, and it is crucial for those that work remotely to meet in person. I suggest once a quarter or during times that require heavy lifting such as launching a product. Most importantly, it builds an irrefutable human connection.

## After Work is Done

Just as you arrived at work, you must leave it. Here is what is essential, "leaving work."

**Finish up and call it a day.** Be disciplined by saying goodbye to your team members. At a particular time or logical break, as it is time to leave, do so! Finish up by letting them know and closing out the apps that connect you.

**Close the door behind you.** As discussed above, with a separate space, exit the area as if you left the office. Signal the end of the day by closing the door. No further work will be done today, physically and digitally.

## Finally

**The most critical skill set is written communication.** Remote working has many benefits, and it also demands a higher form of written communication. Apart from actively doing your work, continually improve your skillset on spelling, grammar, rhetoric, and being mindful of your impact on others. There are [tools out there](https://medium.com/@solidi/the-one-about-blogging-cd9e65a2055b) that can assist writing well.

**Go for it, you got this!** Remote work requires purpose, intention, and transparency. With a little practice and keeping the tips in mind above, you will do your best job ever. The benefits can be amazing.
