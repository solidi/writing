In this post, I'll share what I've learned from working remotely (and leading distributed teams) over the years.

Working at home is a *mental game*. These tips will keep the reader productive, effective, and balanced.

## Before Arriving at Work

Here are my essential tips right before heading "into work."

**Keeping a routine.** As if going to work, keep the ritual the same. Eat breakfast as planned. Shower and dress the part. Signal that we are ready to begin working. Placing "the uniform" on improves concentration and pride in work.

**Walk to work.** Without commuting, stress will be reduced, but work and personal life boundaries will be hard to discern. So in the absence of travel, go for a walk! The action will set the mood as if arriving at the office. Benefits compound [health and mind](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-manager-stew-dd59cd653728), like listening to focused podcasts during the trek.

## While at Work

Once arriving home, here is what is essential "while at work."

**Find a particular place in the home.** Having a different space in the house is vital as a dedicated place to work. Preferably a room with a door is best. However, this is a luxury for many. So carve an area that is work only.

**Equipment does matter.** Having a fast computer and a reliable internet connection is vital. And the accessories are also crucial. Having noise-canceling headphones helps to reduce distractions. For those that want to go further, a separate boom stand and professional mic to improve the presence of audio-video conferences can be amazing.

**Standing up is essential.** There is a reason why standup desks are pedantic in the [software industry](https://medium.com/gitconnected/be-amazing-in-your-new-engineering-role-2fe005cf3e0). They do matter. While many do not have one at home, it will be a good investment. Regardless, it is essential to switch between sitting down and standing up when working. Do this frequently, like at the office.

**Transition into work.** While it is incredibly convenient to join the first meeting of the day "cold," it is a good practice to "burn in" before. Having this half-hour to sync on goals can make remote work highly productive.

**For all meetings, video is always on.** Now at home, it is imperative to cue into the human side of working. It makes sense to keep the video on for most meetings. Smile, and be social. We all desire this connection. Facial expressions do build trust. If you cannot, that's okay. Let them know your video will be off.

**Be intentional in communicating effectively.** The prominent benefit of remote working is the periods when one can be productive. In software, we enter deep work, and it's lovely. However, we must balance this with intentionality. Actively reaching out to others on the proper channels is essential. Whether it's for the team, a follow-up, or the role demands it, do it well.

**Active follow-up in minutes, not hours.** The contract above goes both ways. For those that seek contact, be sure to answer incoming messages in a timely manner intentionally. If someone cannot actively engage, state this and a time for the query or chat. Swift acknowledgment is critical for all incoming team messages.

**Take lunch.** It is essential to step away from the desk during lunchtime. Take the time to decompress. Go out and get fresh air, too. As a subtle side effect, lunches will be cheaper and healthier since groceries are at home.

## Work with the Team Well

As the reader works, apart from the tips above, they can work "well with the team."

**Intentionally build team culture.** Team building is essential, and there are plenty of ways to gather remotely. We can take the lead! Your teammates want to know about us. Set up a time for regular socializing, [online happy hours](https://skribbl.io/), and brainstorming sessions. Do it frequently by inviting everyone.

**Make artifacts easily discoverable.** With remote work, hallway conversations happen less frequently. Keeping a central place of knowledge (such as a wiki) is critical to organize artifacts such as decision and design docs. Importantly, be proactively transparent on progress in tools the team uses.

**Persistent video hangouts may help.** For those teams that require collaboration, having a centrally located video chat open during working hours can work well. Anyone can bring forward a topic and actively discuss it. Virtually tapping on another shoulder is possible with this setup.

**The ability to flex with time zones.** Distributed teams span across the world. Remotely working from home can provide flexing hours to accommodate active contribution and being present at team rituals.

**Regularly meeting in person is paramount.** After all, we are storytelling humans, and it is crucial for those working remotely to meet in person. Once a quarter or during times that require heavy lifting, such as launching a product, is a good suggestion. Most importantly, it builds an irrefutable human connection.

## After Work is Done

Just as we arrive at work, we must leave it. Here is what is essential, "leaving work."

**Finish up and call it a day.** Be disciplined by saying goodbye to the team members. Do so at a particular time or logical break when it's time to leave! Finish up by letting them know and closing out the apps which connect us. For me, I transition to [a hobby](https://medium.com/@solidi/cq-personal-mastery-through-hobbies-f25aab2e49ad) for the last half hour that is unrelated to work.

**Close the door.** As discussed above, with a separate space, exit the area as if we left the office. Signal the end of the day by closing the door. No further work will be done today, physically and digitally.

**Build relationships outside work.** While most of our time is now at home or in a transitional space, continue strengthening relationships outside work. Being intentional about maintaining [old and new bonds](https://medium.com/@solidi/the-world-i-worked-into-no-longer-exists-732659963058) will be essential for wellness!

## Finally

**The most critical skill set is written communication.** Remote working demands a higher form of [written communication](https://medium.com/@solidi/reply-all-considered-harmful-f895beb5eabc). Apart from actively doing work, continually improve skill sets on spelling, grammar, rhetoric, and being mindful of the impact on others. There are [tools out there](https://medium.com/@solidi/the-one-about-blogging-cd9e65a2055b) that can assist in writing well.

**Go for it! You got this!** Remote work requires purpose, intention, and transparency. You will do your best job with a bit of practice and keeping the tips in mind above. The benefits can be amazing.
