# Deconstructing My Reading Habits
## Understanding my Purposeful Discipline for Knowledge

Recently I had a conversation about my reading habits. Speaking through it, I realized the process I follow is *purposeful*. To better understand my motivations, I drew a diagram, similar to [how I blog](https://medium.com/@solidi/the-one-about-blogging-cd9e65a2055b). In this write, I will step through and highlight the essential parts. By sharing my thinking with others, it will memorialize my important goal.

## My Inspiration for Reading Books Comes From Others

When I choose books to read, commitment sparks from a conversation with another individual, mentor, or leader combined with a *motivation* factor. This recommendation aligns with a challenge I am experiencing or a skillset to improve. For instance, when I wanted a more holistic view of distributed systems in software [in system design interviews](https://medium.com/swlh/the-one-about-software-engineering-interviewing-6f126e3a3171), a recommendation for *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* improved my proficiency.

There are many routes to how I discover books. I am radically open to recommendations, and in some instances, I openly ask others. Book recommendations are also sourced from *asynchronous mentorship* — listening carefully to podcasts, YouTube, or crawling Amazon adjacent book recommendation lists.

## My Idling Time is Where Most Reading Occurs

My reading habits are sporadic. Most reading occurs in a gap of time where I am sitting or idling. Scheduling this time is usually not sustainable. The most crucial point is that I am reading at least a few pages a day, even if it’s not chunked (such as reading one full chapter in a sitting). The books are usually with me, and I prefer the physical book over a digital format to keep focused.

# When Reading, I Note What is Interesting

I do not entirely understand my “interesting” scale, but I know how they appear in the text. These artifacts are impactful quotes, an interesting idea, or applied application. Things that are **terse and succinct** positively engage me. I thought about this one for a while where interest originated and gave up noting the values, morals, and beliefs of my upbringing, culture, and experiences. From a skillset point of view, my “interesting” are points of detail, procession, and novel application methods.

Like Robert Heatons *[How I Read](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/)*, the way I track “interesting” includes a small system of Post-It flags and essential note-taking. The organization system needs improvement. Regardless, every book I’ve read has a handful of concepts and symbols that seem to stick with me creating a never-ending snowball of knowledge.

## Completing Books is Important To Me

When committing to a book, it is a combination of recommendations, timeliness in context, and extracting interesting points, actions, and understanding. Most books I start, I do finish. I believe it is essential to complete a reading because it increases my momentum to the next book (and knowing I can consume a book.) And rarely, for those books that I abandon, it at least gives a story to tell.

## My Outcomes and Tangibles of Reading Books

For me, reading has always been a story about foraging and gathering new pieces of the context in some way. These items are valuable, for example, understanding *anchoring* from *Thinking Fast and Slow*, the *STARS* model from *The First 90 Days*, *the task-relevant maturity* model of *High Output Management*, and *mastering the art of letting go* from *Eleven Rings*. The list is incrementally exhaustive. Foraging **improves vocabulary**. Discovering the vocabulary builds a **mental model of the idea** expressed. The tangibles of the outcomes are clear — exercising thoughts, speaking through the topic is enhanced through gained language, and it is a never-ending cycle of approximation. In some instances, they are connecting ideas from two different viewpoints.

## My Reading Leads to Mentorship

As I read books that are purposeful in context, it has become clear my immediate goal is to *mentor others*. Stories and recommendations become accessible, and building trustful relationships have improved. The outcome is the inspiration to write to a community. For example, when I read the book, *Hackers and Painters*, I connected the disparate and describe mentoring others [about a hobby](https://medium.com/the-innovation/cq-personal-mastery-through-hobbies-f25aab2e49ad) through “successive approximation.” Reading the meta books on software engineering — *Programming Pearls*, *Pragmatic Programmer*, and *The Philosophy of Software Design* — gave me the vocabulary of [correctness and pattern matching](https://medium.com/hackernoon/meta-skills-of-a-software-engineer-bed411f6685e). With all of these writes, I continue to improve my diction.

## My Reading Leads to Writing a Book

My future goal has become apparent. The books I’ve been reading over the years have **influenced me to write a book** — their content and physical format are my inspiration. The book will be a legacy of the many readings and my application of doing what I learned from them. Hence, for me, the purpose of why I read books is to write a new book into this meta pipeline; **to share what I’ve learned**. However, I am unsure of what *novel concept* to cover but trust [it will come in time](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/09/29/is-book-writing-worth-it.html).

![Part 7](images/31-07.png)

As I noted in the diagram above, *100x posts* is a critical concept. By writing enough and receiving feedback will guide me to achieve the goal. The format will likely be essay-based — exploring *concepts* to a narrative arc.

## Conclusion

Reading books has become a delightful process of learning and writing what is interesting in my own experience. After reading the article, *[How to Read Fewer Books](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/how-to-read-fewer-books/)*, I’m discovering my eventual goal in reading books. My approach is not rigorous. It is **constant and continuous**. The core parts of it are sourcing, consumption, and continue to improve *my meta reading machine*. While I do not remember everything that I read — ideas, thoughts, and previous readings become unlocked in conversation. I experience Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote:

> I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

My motivation to read is to gain a purposeful skillset to give back content in multiple synthesized forms — a creative exhaust. Your reasons may be very different than mine. What works for you?
