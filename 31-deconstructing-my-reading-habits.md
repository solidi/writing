# Deconstructing My Reading Habits
## Understanding my Purposeful Discipline for Knowledge

Recently I had a conversation about my reading habits. Speaking through it, I realized the process I follow is *purposeful*. To better understand my motivations, I drew a diagram, similar to [how I blog](https://medium.com/@solidi/the-one-about-blogging-cd9e65a2055b). In this write, I will step through and highlight the essential parts. Sharing my process with others will memorialize my goal - writing a book.

## My Inspiration for Reading Books Comes from Others

When I choose books to read, commitment sparks from a conversation with another individual, mentor, or leader combined with a *motivation* factor. This recommendation aligns with a challenge I am experiencing or a skill set to improve. For instance, when I wanted a holistic view of distributed systems in software [in system design interviews](https://medium.com/swlh/the-one-about-software-engineering-interviewing-6f126e3a3171),  *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* improved my proficiency.

There are many routes to how I discover books. I am radically open to recommendations, and in some instances, I openly ask others. Book recommendations are also sourced from *asynchronous mentorship* — listening carefully to podcasts, YouTube, or crawling Amazon book recommendation lists.  If the recommendation is *timely* and has potential *return on discovery*, I will commit to reading the book.

## My Idling Time is Where Most Reading Occurs

My reading habits are sporadic, occuring in a gap of time when I am sitting or idling. Scheduling this time is usually not sustainable. The crucial point is I read at least a few pages a day, even if it’s not chunked (such as reading one full chapter in a sitting). The books follow me, and I prefer the physical book over a digital format to keep focused.

# When Reading, Note What is Interesting

I do not entirely understand my “interesting” scale, but I know how they appear in the text. These artifacts are impactful quotes, interesting ideas, or applied applications. Things that are **terse and succinct** positively engage me. I thought about this one for a while where interest originated from morals, values, and beliefs of my upbringing, culture, and experiences. From a skill set point of view, my "interests" are detailed information and novel application methods.

Like Robert Heatons *[How I Read](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/)*, the way I track "interests" is a small system of Post-It flags and note-taking. My organization system needs improvement. Regardless, every book I’ve read has a handful of concepts and symbols that stick with me creating a never-ending snowball of knowledge.

## Completing Books is Important to Me

When committing to a book, it is a combination of recommendations, timeliness, extracting interesting points, and understanding actions. Books I start, I finish. I believe it is essential to complete a reading because it supports my momentum to start the next book.

Books that I abandon form a new story as to why I disliked the work.

## My Outcomes and Tangibles of Reading Books

For me, reading is a process of gathering new pieces of the context. Information and the experience they contain are valuable, for example, understanding *anchoring* from *Thinking Fast and Slow*, the *STARS* model from *The First 90 Days*, the *task-relevant maturity* model of *High Output Management*, and *mastering the art of letting go* from *Eleven Rings*.

Foraging **improves vocabulary**. Discovering the vocabulary builds a **mental model of the idea** expressed. The tangibles of the outcomes are clear —  exercising thoughts and speaking through the topic enhances connections to others, and the process is a never-ending cycle of approximation. In some instances, books connect ideas from different viewpoints, and in the end, form new opinions for me.

## My Reading Leads to Mentorship

As I read books that are purposeful in context, my goal is to *mentor others*. Telling stories of books builds trustful relationships. And the side effect is the inspiration to write openly to a community.

For example, when I read the book, *Hackers and Painters*, I connected the disparate, describing mentoring others [about a hobby](https://medium.com/the-innovation/cq-personal-mastery-through-hobbies-f25aab2e49ad) through “successive approximation.” Reading meta books on software engineering — such as *Programming Pearls*, *Pragmatic Programmer*, and *The Philosophy of Software Design* — equipped me the vocabulary of [correctness and pattern matching](https://medium.com/hackernoon/meta-skills-of-a-software-engineer-bed411f6685e).

## My Reading Leads to Writing a Book

My future goal is clear. The books I’ve read have **influenced me to write a book** — their content are my inspiration. My book will be a legacy of the  readings and what I've learned from them.

The purpose of why I read books is to write a new book for someone else - **to share what I’ve learned**. However, I am unsure of what *concept* to cover. I trust [it will come in time](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/09/29/is-book-writing-worth-it.html).

![Writing a book](images/31-07.png)

As I noted in the diagram above, *100x posts* is a critical concept. Writing enough and receiving feedback guides me to achieve the goal. The format will be essay-based — exploring *concepts* to a narrative arc.

## Conclusion

Reading books is a delightful process of learning. And writing is a result of reading books. The article, *[How to Read Fewer Books](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/how-to-read-fewer-books/)*, I'm discovered my goal in reading books. My approach is not rigorous. It is **constant and continuous**. The core parts of my process are sourcing and to improve *my meta reading machine*. While I do not remember everything that I read — ideas, thoughts, and previous writings unlock new conversation. Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote describes what I feel:

> I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

My reading motivation is to develop a purposeful skill set and to give back content — a creative exhaust as described by Brad Frost. Your reasons may be different from mine. What works for you?
