# Upcoming Book: Deconstructive Software Ramblings
## Essays from the Mind of an Engineering Manager During the COVID Era

![The Cover](images/90-01.jpeg)

DECONSTRUCTIVE SOFTWARE RAMBLINGS, *Essays from the Mind of an Engineering Manager*, explores this author's thoughts and feelings about the software industry.

Published over seven years, these compositions highlight the author's gripes and praises of software. In between, these essays instruct the uninitiated, explore meta-insights, provide reflections, and develop crossovers of engineering into everyday life.

DSR was written by someone who worked in "Big Tech," feeling the burn of on-call. While he ascended on *HackerNews* by sheer determination, this author was humiliated in the industry's technical interviews - *more than twice* - but kept on coding.

So join the author on a navel-gazing tour of mind-bending writeups resulting from his admiration of the technical, delivering a passionate cry in a digital valley. Amazing logical deconstruction of software engineering concepts is contained within.
And you'll be left wondering: Was this book worth your time? To the half million who viewed these essays, perhaps the answer is "*it depends.*"

DSR will be available for purchase by the end of the year.

I'm happy to announce the release of my first #book, Deconstructive Software Ramblings, Essays from the Mind of an Engineering Manager!

This year has been wild, and I was "given time" to do something else, so I had an idea. Over many years, I've been openly writing about software experiences related to #soft #skills, #software #practices, #career #development, #role definitions, #blogging, #reading, #interviewing, and "thinking" software crossovers in everyday life. 

So, why not "clean up" the essays and combine them? Thus, "DSR" was born.

DSR is an outlier, different, weird, and genuine. But it may just help a struggling manager, a software engineer intern, a principal engineer looking for inspiration [or furious debate], or a #software #leader who is reflecting.

My message is (and always be), "You should #write!"

The back of the book acknowledges many people. Still, a special thank you goes to those who helped or inspired essays that appear in the book: Steve Guyer, Pratik Dhiman, Andrea Gordon, Daniel Leonardis, Manoj Thopcherneni, John Pavley, John Elden Revano, my dad Douglas J. Arcuri -- and especially to Hazem Saleh.

While some essays have reached the top of #HackerNews, over a half-million people have viewed my essays, and a quarter million have "read them." Are you interested? See below.
