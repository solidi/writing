What if a reader was treated like an adult, retelling the *best and worst* American inventive toy stories so few published works dare to write?

This blog is on a mission to publish those tales. These vignettes are authored using the mosaic theory of information and tell the truth based on sources and evidence.

Using artificial intelligence and old-fashioned storytelling, sources are combined to create unusual narratives about the toy industry. From podcasts to legal documents, patents to social media, and books to newspapers, these stories are free to read and will remain that way.

Now, each story will join an anthology compiled into a book tentatively titled *Technical Toy Stories: An Anthology of Real American Inventions, Volume One*.*

The target for the book’s release is Fall 2025.

## The Motivation

This author has been fascinated with [toy patent drawings](https://ipwatchdog.com/2018/12/23/iconic-patented-toys-games/id=91631/) and the stories behind their creation, seeking to uncover lesser-known engineers and inventors.

These beautiful sketches granted by the [UPSTO](https://www.uspto.gov/) have influenced American society. *Technical Toy Stories* studies patents close to the final product, filling a gap to retell their origins in a fascinating curated collection.

The intrigue started when this author realized his childhood toys had become "evergreen," meaning they are sold in similar forms today.

Then, this author started the quest to research their original technicians and recreate their human invention tales.

These expired patents, now in the public domain, have impacted the lives of millions of children and the wallets of adults.

Many stories remain scattered through various incomplete sources. This book pulls them together and recreates their drama. Discernible inventors are quoted throughout.

Each tale within *Technical Toy Stories* features timeless products that lasted over a generation, recognized by Americans.

### This Book is Not For Children

*Technical Toy Stories* is written in a way that is easy to understand. The goal is to make the content interesting and surprising. It's not intended for children.

What sets this anthology apart is its anchor to the patent and its unflinching attitude to truth in history. It contains selected works that streaming entertainment documentaries will not cover.

Topics include difficult subjects such as death, lack of safety, injury, shifts in manufacturing, injustice, etc.

This anthology reflects the industry's unease, focusing on American-cultured toys, many from powerful corporations. But make no mistake, "feel-good" origin stories are mixed within. *

And yeah, the industry has experienced some wild stories. *Technical Toy Stories* retells them.

### Chapters in the Book

Picking up *Technical Toy Stories* provides the convenience of having everything under one thumb. Read it (or this blog) to understand lesser-known American inventive toy stories.

*Technical Toy Stories* growing index follows. Each story contains a patent postlude(s). While focusing on "boy toys," alternative topics are being researched.
