Not comprehension, but clarity.

## List

    1. curious, approach, tradeoffs, and weighing options, value model, [untools](https://untools.co/).
    1. contribute ideas and be open to feedback.
    1. tests, performance analysis, clean code, and [human readable/meta](https://medium.com/@solidi/the-many-senses-of-software-engineering-aba9f289498c).
    1. naming and taming ideas, metaphors.
    1. directed thought, stewing, [construction](https://medium.com/hackernoon/software-is-unlike-construction-c0284ee4b723) stumbling to solutions,
    1. the code writen is not your value, since its build on sand and washes away. its the thought that does.

            - linkedin
        - Study buddy
            - History
            - Code
            - Stories
            - System Design
    - Completing the loops
        - Reflecting on what works
        - Thank yous

    - Point of write is to share the learnings
        - It is a feedback loop
        - Requires a study buddy
        - Iterations of technical review
            - Behavior
            - Technical
        - Knowing you are connecting
    - Link to technical interview and podcast
    - Study Buddy
    - Kanban board
    - Updating the resume on every interview
    - Think of one thing to improve upon if rejected
