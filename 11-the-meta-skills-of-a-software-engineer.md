![Above, some books on meta on how to craft software well.](images/11-01.png)

Recently, a friend asked a question about the particular skills possessed by software engineers.

> *What are the unique skills that software engineers practice?*

Drawing from my experience led me to an opinion. I enjoy the meta of programming. The skill of learning the *meta*, or how to do what programmers do better, includes reading well-known books in context.

I took specific examples of what I read over the years, applied it to my observations practicing in the field, and I answered in a pragmatic way.

> *In my opinion, I would say it is the practice of correctness and pattern recognition. These are the skills that are unique to software engineers.*

Let's examine these skills to add context.

## Correctness

Correctness is related to **how** and **why** programmers [build things](https://medium.com/hackernoon/software-is-unlike-construction-c0284ee4b723) the way they do. In organizations, it is associated with the accuracy of what the business must solve for its customers. Well written software follows this thinking.

Correctness is *how correct the "how" is.* The solution should meet the customer expectations. The practice is a balance of strategy (designing) and tactics (execution).

The examination of the *how's how* in a vacuum appears in chapter four of [Programming Pearls](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Bentley-Programming-Pearls-2nd-Edition/PGM203056.html) - "Writing Correct Programs."

> *...keeping code simple is usually the key to correctness.*

> - Jon Bentley

## Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition ties to the **organization** of **correctness** by creating the necessary abstractions and component boundaries. Pattern recognition forms modularize code. Programmers monitor duplication, find areas of reuse, and refactor complicated parts of the system. It is what [software engineers](https://dev.to/solidi/what-is-a-software-engineer-anyway-3fb2) do well. Their attention to that detail is vigilant. Programmers recognize knowledge as it is created over and over again. Then they simplify the code.

Pattern recognition is discussed at length in the community, and there are many sources that describe their techniques. The origins where I learned about this skill reside in chapter two of [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) - "The Evils Of Duplication."

> *Make it easy to reuse. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.*

> - Andrew Hunt & Dave Thomas

## A Teachable Moment

Once I answered my friend's question, he followed up with another question.

> *If correctness and pattern recognition are these skills, how do you teach them?*

My answer was simple enough.

> *Locate these books, set the environment, and work through by offering examples. Set the expectation of learning and practicing these meta skills while delivering value to business. Why? Complexity. Practicing is the best investment of learning the skill of balancing complexity, resulting in engineers who are confident over time.*

My mentoring focuses on these books and these particular skills. The practice made me realize there are few who invest heavily in the meta, apart from doing the work. The vocabulary of the meta is something I have an interest in. My writings on [problem decomposition](https://medium.com/hackernoon/no-description-provided-8d9e0f3a3abb) (correctness) and [organization](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-decision-hypothesis-aa512e0113) (pattern recognition) were difficult to see when in the heat of delivery.

At about the time I wrote this brief on these skills, I received a book recommendation. A professor at Stanford has been teaching a course on the meta. His study resulted in an edition of his course findings. I found out that he has the same gripe as me. I purchased the book and devoured it from chapter thirteen, [*A Philosophy Of System Design*](https://twitter.com/JohnOusterhout/status/989260683836506112).

> *Engineers tend to be very detail oriented. We love details and are good at managing lots of them; this is essential for being a good engineer. But, great software designers can also step back from the details and think about a system at a higher level.*

> - John Ousterhout**

## Conclusion

In my opinion, correctness and pattern recognition are skills*** that software engineers do well at. The result is *higher quality software*. All other unique skills, if there are others to categorize, stem from these concepts.

I invite others to share examples of meta-skills they have practiced over time.

Fundamentally, correctness and pattern recognition have tie-ins to outcomes of complexity (also known as cognitive load). Programmers balance both so that they mitigate complexity. In essence, this is why these skills are the distillation of what they do.

\* *What is interesting about correctness and pattern recognition is they also have a strong association with practices around machine learning.*

** *If you want to know more about what John is doing, take a look at [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajFq31OV9Bk).*

*** *Engineers should also practice high levels of learning and communication. These concepts aren't unique to software but have strong associations with the sciences.*

## Social Post

Imho, #Software #engineers excel at pattern recognition and correctness.

- Engineers tend to be very detailed oriented.
- Engineers keep code simple to improve correctness.
- They recognize knowledge as it is created over and over again. Then they simplify.
- Engineers should also practice high levels of learning and communication.
- These metas result is higher quality software.
