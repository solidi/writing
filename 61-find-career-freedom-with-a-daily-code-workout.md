There are two main modes of physical exercise, [aerobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise) and [anaerobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_exercise). Aerobics train the body to maintain output throughout distributed muscles. Its goal is to preserve oxygen levels along a strenuous distance. Anaerobic exercises target muscle groups under resistance repetitions until the muscles cannot perform further. The goal is to improve the energy output of the muscle target by tearing and rebuilding. Both modes have benefits associated with peak performance.

## Dealing with Software

[Software engineers](https://dev.to/solidi/what-is-a-software-engineer-anyway-3fb2) perform their craft in a similar manner. If one takes a step back, the resemblance of aerobic exercise is to solve problems, such as handling an unformed concern and unraveling it. However,  engineers cannot complete the activity because they need specific "muscles" to command a solution, which requires strength to achieve endurance.

Engineers perform targeted "anaerobic" workouts to improve problem-solving endurance to achieve aerobic results. But why perform exercises and spend time doing what seems trivial? The answer is simple, freedom to solve problems. As a benefit, [career options](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/interview-well-for-your-next-incredible-engineering-role-a5513e6596ae?sk=fd06c4775ff3e9d912be078e6854c64f) will expand when we gracefully perform various computer science skills. We choose where to spend time motivated by solving interesting problems.

## Targets

The core engineering workout is a process of concentration and effort. It requires about one hour of practice daily. If every day is too rigorous, exercise every other day to let the mind rest. Rotate a reduced set throughout the week. Either way, working to solve known problems builds muscles in the brain, particularly the neocortex. Like [code katas](http://codekata.com/), these exercises target building muscle memory.

1. **Temporal:** relating to temporary space. Holding items in mind is a skill that practice improves.
1. **Spatial:** relating to visualizing how these exercises interrelate with data.
1. **Speaking:** [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) through the problem challenges communication. Think: how can I teach this to someone?
1. **Recollectio:n** these workouts target a wide range of muscles, memorizing essential patterns. Repeating them leads to working efficiently within an integrated development environment.
1. **Abstract:** Learning something new. Discovering a new workout, we add computer science fundamentals to expand our knowledge.

## The Workout

Like a physical exercise regime, these exercises require a warm-up to get the mind thinking clearly. Vigorous activities follow. After a certain amount of rotations, results include solving complex problems in less time. Craving to perform will follow, such as desiring spicy food from our [TRPV1 pain receptors](https://www.businessinsider.com/eating-spicy-food-capsaicin-hot-pepper-side-effects-2017-10).

### Warm Up (5 minutes)

Create an array, fill it with random integers, and print it to the screen. Or execute the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html) recursively and iteratively.

### Sorts (10 minutes)

Exercise integer sorting in order of difficulty. [Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), Selection, Insertion, Shell, [Merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort), Quick, Heap. Finalize with binary search iteratively and recursively. Describe the [Big O-notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) as well.

### Maps / Hashes or Stacks / Queues (10 Minutes)

Create a naive [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) and basic hashing to avoid collisions. Or build [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))/queues with finding the minimum or maximum on a stack.

### Trees or Double Linked List (10 Minutes)

Create a [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) by inserting nodes, printing traversals, and deleting a node. As an alternative, create a [doubly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list). Insert, delete, and print in both directions.

### Graphs (15 Minutes)

Create and traverse graphs using breadth-first and depth-first search, or experiment with the [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) and [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).

### Alternative (15 Minutes)

Solve a question from the [*Cracking The Coding Interview*](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) problem [openly](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-organize-your-thoughts-on-the-whiteboard-and-crush-your-technical-interview-b668de4e6941). Adding these questions to the workout will inspire thinking by amending the repetitive nature of the previous exercises. If solving canned problems isn't attractive, build [something variable.](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/10/26/variable-mastery/)

### System (15 Minutes)

Rotate a complex (seen above) question and a system design question in a regular cadence. For system design questions, it starts as "Build YouTube," or "Build Google Maps." Today, free videos are available which through their logical steps â€” some as fast at ten minutes!

## The Conclusion is Core Strength

A disciplined workout is key to a healthy engineer, whether a [leader](https://dev.to/solidi/what-is-a-tech-lead-anyway-483p) or an individual contributor. The goal is discipline, first to remedy the repetitions by gradually reducing the time to solve. Once achieving results, "aerobic" problem-solving exercises will come naturally because conditioned muscles are trained to execute well.

There is a certain satisfaction to these exercises. Why not strive to be a well-rounded engineer? If one hour seems lengthy, reduce the set, building toward a new goal. Importantly, push hard at the end of the exercise to finish well.
