# What is a Tech Lead Anyway?
#leadership, #team, #career, #mentorship

It's quite hard to define the tech lead role in a short post. But, here it goes.

**The lead is a role, not a title.** Any software engineer can become the tech lead. And with the part, others will look up to this leader.

**The lead is the team liaison. The role shepherds change.** They focus on the future state. The rapid response. The pivots from management.

**Tech leads play the role of mentor and sponsor to others.** They setup code reviews in a collaborative way. They handle [discourse](https://uvwx.github.io/hierarchy.html). They partner with the product on feasibility, on a roadmap, priority, and estimations.

**They are accountable for the developer's experience**. The technical debt and engineering velocity. The tooling and onboarding friction. The testing, product domain, and holding philosophies to approaches.

**They write down the philosophies so that decisions are apparent.** They are the guide with respect â€” a leader who delegates as well as leads by example.

**Being a tech lead can be a challenge.** Managers pressure them to do the impossible. Priorities come to them in all directions. Their impact is good or bad, whether the team is [pathological or generative](https://changelog.com/posts/how-to-build-a-generative-engineering-culture).

**The lead is there to see the team succeed, to deliver.** Without internal injuries, with an orchestra of collaborative engineers rising.

**The brutality of being a tech lead is the demand for the individual's technical and management capability.** Even though companies have split these into two ladders, the role of tech lead has intractable attributes of both. It is impossible to separate.

**The team can blaze a path in the lead's absence.** Whereas the real drama happens in one's head, the pure emotion of the group occurs in front of the tech leads eyes. The lead follows through it and guides.

**They lead with a myriad of soft skills jujitsu**. With the technical tact unmatched. And if it all goes wrong, no worries. There are [marketing opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw).
