# The Manager Stew
## Management Happens Before Core Working Hours

I overheard someone say, “management is hard.” Thank you for the courageous statement. You inspired me to write this short.

Management is extraordinarily hard. The perception of the profession is *thankless* because we play the role of business. And we get it from all sides. The company takes priority. The individual performing the role of a manager takes a back seat.

The *how* of management is by doing. Mentors are virtually [distant](https://randsinrepose.com/). I know through training and experience, it has many facets and methods. After some years, I have invented a style of moving ideas into action. And in my own opinion, most of the management’s work is completed before core working hours.

## The Stew

What is management? Perhaps it could be logically reduced to a standard set of tools. The one on ones, the staff meetings, the feedback, delegation, performance, and coaching models. Difficult conversations. *[You cannot be friends, but you can be friendly.](https://www.manager-tools.com/)*

I like to introduce a new multitool, primarily a compass. With some years into the profession, I have formed a pattern called ***the stew***. It is time before work that determines the day, while simultaneously holding a vision of myself, the individuals, and teams in the future.

> The stew happens during a lengthly walk before work.

A [Moleskine Cahier pocket](https://us.moleskine.com/cahier-journal-black/p0411) notebook supports thinking time. After the walk, I jot essential items that are bouncing around in my head. A lot of these thoughts are replays of conversations and exciting bits that accrete into vision and direction.

## Why?

The *stew* informally means a state of anxiety or agitation. As a food, a beautiful blend of savory taste simmered with time. My definition is an intense thought process marred in a cycle of logic and passion. The label was a natural fit.

The *stew* attempts to organize and prioritize outcomes. This thinking can include analyzing conversations, weighing fairness of actions, and identifying ownership. I replay conversations to empathize. This process is a place where positive behaviors are recognized and brought forward.

I await a new opportunity to say what was resolved in thought the same day — all thanks to *the stew*. It promotes compassionate leadership and helps steer with positive intentions.

*The stew* also reveals inefficiencies. And my flaws. It allows systems thinking and connecting things that would not be connected.

> The stew surfaces things that need attention.

*The stew* is an essential strategy for leaders. For example, in the industry of software engineering where I work, leaders identify core directions. Long goalposts will emerge. “Engineers own the quality,” “We never go it alone,” “This is not a technology problem,” “Software is about people,” and “The code is the truth” are tenants that have emerged in my stew sessions over and over again.

Over a few years, I have managed *with the stew*. When exhausted, I minimize the passionate thought process by listening to podcasts. *Listening is a way to compartmentalize the stew*. And this is where I learn more about the craft of management and software engineering every single working day.

> The stew is a place to continuously learn.

## Conclusion

Management is about wading through the vagueness and ambiguity of interrelationships in the quest for alignment and business results. *The stew is a place to navigate*. It has revealed decision points that would not have come and have eased emotional frustration. The stew has unveiled larger visionary goals for the teams I’ve led.

> The result is growth in relationships and heighten performance of myself and others.

I remember numerous stews where it was painfully obvious that I tried everything to coach an individual. Through all the work, there was no other choice — *all* options where exhausted. *The stew* provided that clarity.

Do you have a similar tool?
