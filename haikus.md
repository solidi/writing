# Haikus

Some drafted haikus. Demostrates experience, hope, wisdom, and depth. And also humor, irony, banality.

## Tech

capture the user  
stack trace show me the new work  
patched, on to the next  

new image service  
cross fingers cache will hold up  
million object serves  

an ethernet cord  
stranded bandwidth perfection  
argh, git reset HEAD  

many services  
duplication is ok  
learn and build again  

## Writing

morning sunshine light  
another attempt to write  
nothing comes to mind
