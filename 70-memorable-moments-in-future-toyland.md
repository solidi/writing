![From the book TOYLAND: The High-Stakes Game of the Toy Industry.](images/70-01.jpeg)

The book [*Toyland: High-Stakes Game of the Toy Industry*](https://peopleofplay.com/blog/toyland-the-high-stakes-game-of-the-toy-industry) provides fascinating insights into the golden era of toy making. The authors, Stern and Schoenhaus, generously compiled a looking glass of determined business people, the veracious trade, and the insight into developing Tyco's [Dino-Riders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino-Riders) at the height of the 1980s [deregulated](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/01/arts/ftc-drops-consideration-of-rule-on-children-s-tv-ads.html) US market.

Toyland captures an advanced industry of yesteryear. At a time before 3D printing and deep Hollywood partnerships, today's impressionable manufacturers admire the late personalities who forged modern toy-making craft. In this century, the industry is supported by high-budget entertainment, an adaptation to keep the business rolling strong.

```

If there is one person's extraordinary impact in the story, it would be [Bernard Loomis](https://www.rebelscum.com/loomis.asp) ("Bernie"). In the second half of the 20th century, the toy industry credits Bernie, who promoted the concept of the expanding toy line and coined the term "toyetic," the natural ability for a property to expand into successful product lines. He learned the craft at Mattel for eleven years, connecting the first major buyer to Hot Wheels by selling fifty million units before exiting to Kenner.

Bernie and associates led successful firsts - marrying media TV to toys in the heat of Hot Wheels success (1969), an iconic movie toy line (Star Wars, 1977), and newfound licensing (Strawberry Shortcake and Care Bears, 1980, 1983). Bernie avoided "driving by looking in the [rear-view mirror](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-10-14-fi-14807-story.html)," instead making decisions by instinct. He consulted throughout the industry, reinforcing expandable collectability, and trained upcoming professionals paving the way for the 21st century.

## Addendum to Toyetic Appendix

While kids binge on digital streams and live in virtual worlds, a single-conscious TV promotional world [is of the past](https://mindmatters.ai/2018/09/children-are-watching-much-less-tv/). Commercials [were an invention of this industry](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1986/10/where-toys-come-from/306213/), detailed by essayist David Owen. Children today have endless choices. They consume digital streams or participate in worlds (Minecraft, Roblox) with others on information-age devices.

Since Toyland's release thirty-five years ago, a gap exists in its epilogue. So, a curated physical toy appendix follows. It focuses on North American-headquartered toy manufacturing entities in the spirit of the author's intent.

```

The exponential threads of Toyland have exploded since the book was written. For example, the choice to play differently branched as the book was published during the "second video gaming boom," led by Nintendo, never letting up. Kid digital game media has become [something of its own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_Wars_(book)).

In the mid-1990s, deeper ties were established to the big screen between the partnership of [Hasbro and Dreamworks](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/17/business/hasbro-and-dreamworks-join-to-wed-entertainment-and-toys.html), signaling the dawn of entertainment-first toy-making. Storytelling core brands are critical intellectual property in maturing multimedia entertainment of the 21st century.

Surprisingly, patterns pioneered by Bernie Loomis remain, with teams of people achieving greatness, making Mr. Loomis's [impact unique](https://www.kennercollector.com/2011/03/interview-with-bernard-bernie-loomis-president-of-kenner/). Since his exit, movie promotion (streaming, too) tie-ins have followed the vision of expandable toy lines of perennial brands, offering rebooted retro and collector toylines for children who refuse to grow up.

## Virtual Warehouses Sell Children's Toys and Entertainment

What remains is a toy industry reinventing itself through numerous booms and busts. Each merger and acquisition has consolidated the toy industry, making many companies "multi-brands." For those high-impulse, low-cost toys play a saturated role. The fidget and sensory toy boom has been a significant trend.

The signal of the faulting physical toy warehouse began in the 2000s. Once it gave out in 2018, many walked through a Toys 'R' Us for "one last time," acknowledging how extraordinarily iconic it was to a generation. Now, adults buy children's toys and entertainment prominently housed in virtual equivalents with expanding direct-to-consumer options from manufacturers.

The new leader, LEGO, dominates sales. It is a five-way paradoxical toy line containing both imaginative (build anything) and specific (license anything), supports high tactile play patterns, and targets legions of AFOLs (adult fans of LEGO) with premium products. Flush with movie and game tie-in successes, their fifth is in their name - "Play well" in Danish, "Put together" in Latin, and "Eventually first in the post-modern toy industry" in English.

*Should I read Toyland?* Yes, it's a wide angle on how an industry operated, and it is the best historical read in a chaotic industry at the end of the golden era. While the people and places visited have changed, toys have found a way to thrive. Whether at the big box store, online, or on a theatrical streaming service- these dream makers aim to mint new memorable moments, even if they sometimes generate their own.
