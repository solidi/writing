Interviewing can be incredibly rewarding. With understanding, preparation, and reflection, you can secure your next [software engineering](https://dev.to/solidi/what-is-a-software-engineer-anyway-3fb2) role. Here are my essential tips and walkthrough for performing a successful search.

I want to preface that these interviewing findings are based on my personal experiences and shared stories from others, and by no means will this be your experience!

## Before Starting

Here are the core concepts of interviewing. By embracing these, the odds of achieving results may increase.

**Interviewing is an unpredictable system.** Interviewing is more than just self-preparation; it is a natural system of factors that will be beyond your control: timing, luck, relative candidates, budget changes, and the need for the position. Focus on what you can control by increasing proficiency signals. When "no's" are delivered, it wasn't meant to be. Keep going! Naturally, there will be lots of “no’s” before the first “yes!”

**Learning and reflecting reduce luck factors.** For every interview, reflect on performing better. Was there a question that you did not have an answer to? Was there a [problematic technical challenge](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-organize-your-thoughts-on-the-whiteboard-and-crush-your-technical-interview-b668de4e6941) you couldn’t solve or build a solution to your liking? Review the questions and answers given after every conversation, then rework it by seeking better details. *The goal is to have answers at the tip of your tongue!*

**It is a learning feedback loop in an unsafe environment.** Interviews present challenges to candidates because values are at stake, and skills are measured. With each conversation, you are becoming a better individual. Find someone you can lean on at this time. Receiving rejection will be hard because expectations may have been different. 

## Where to Begin

Now that we discussed the interviewing principles, let's talk about committing to landing a new role.

**Interviewing is a commitment.** In my own experience, interviews can take months of dedication before landing your first or next role. Success comes with discipline and practice. Commit to the fact that it is an outcome-based goal. The search ends as you start the new job. *Getting there is a journey*. Work in short increments daily. The commitment is essential to achieving success!

**Know about the companies you apply to.** Take a look at their social media presence as well as previous employee reviews - i.e., Glassdoor.  Make sure these are places you can see yourself working. Knowing the perceived company culture is essential. Look for red flags such as large amounts of employees leaving at once, frequent turnover, a weak business model, and a volatile stock price. Seek the right parts that lead to high employee satisfaction, including mentorship, learning while delivering software, and room for career growth.

**Consistent procession and tracking of applications.** After you commit, as each day goes by, apply to companies that align with your values and advancement. Consistently post your resume. Track your progress with a [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board), or a spreadsheet, so no application goes untracked. Do not be afraid to apply to jobs you *can fail at* or if the *skill sets do not precisely match*!

**Sources are everywhere.** Whether it’s through friends, your university campus, LinkedIn, or your favorite tech blog, opportunities are highly available. Seek channels to post in, and spread out consistently. A variation of subscriptions can increase your chance for the next role. But don’t stop there! Most importantly, lean on the power of networks of friends and colleagues to find the next opportunity. Ask those you have relationships with. They may open the door to an opportunity not seen.

## Once Interviewing Starts

After starting a small conveyor belt of submissions, it may take time for someone to respond. Once they do, let's walk through what to expect.

**There are different types of people you will encounter.** Some are from agencies. Some are internal company recruiters. Either way, they are seeking you as a potential fit for the role. A short *exploratory call* is what to expect. *Partner with them. They are championing for you*. Let them know why you like the company and what skills you bring to the table. Finally, ask them what to expect in the interview process so preparation can be focused.

**Once the recruiter advances your candidacy, expect the interview loop.** If you are a fit, it's either a skills assessment or an initial conversation with the hiring manager. Be yourself and note the questions. If it's a skills assessment, expect a take-home assignment or a web-based one like HackerRank.

**If you do well, you will advance to a final round.** In many cases, a half or full day at their company's office (or remote) with a mixture of two types of interviews. The Behavioral/Leadership type is where you will tell stories about what and how you work. The technical interview is a coding or [system design knowledge conversation](https://dataintensive.net/). Once complete, the process is over just as fast as it started.

## The Offer and Starting the New Role

The company may take a few days or weeks before they return with an answer. If it worked, congrats on getting your first offer! You are reflecting, improving, and finding the role of your dreams.

**For no offer or decline.** Due to many candidates or liability considerations, most companies will decline feedback if you did not receive an offer. Ask! Some feedback can help you improve. Above all, be gracious and accept if you want to change.

**Congrats on the offer! It’s time to negotiate.** When the first offer comes in, it is likely a fair starting offer for the role tailored for the experience. It will depend if it’s right for you! Most companies want to secure you. If you think it’s possible, there may be ways to move this needle. There may be tangibles outside of money to include in that offer. It's up to you if it makes sense. Good luck!

**Clarify benefits.** There are plenty of posts out there that discuss how to negotiate well. Ask questions about benefits, start date, and everything else. Make sure you understand the entire package before you commit.

**Multiple offers.** A purposeful search may yield more than one offer. Having these offers is an excellent position to be. Having multiple offers can give you a more substantial negotiation standing point on the final package. It is up to you on how you like to proceed, take the best offer for your future.

**Start with a fresh mind.** Once you have signed the offer, sit back and relax. It's time to [start a new role](https://dev.to/solidi/be-amazing-in-your-new-engineering-role-1klc). Brush up on technology and company history. Reach out and start a convo with the hiring manager on onboarding tips and thank them for taking the leap together.

## The Other Important Tips

Now that you have a holistic picture of this process and what to expect, here are my hard-won tips after going through interviews over the years.

**Interviewing is a skillset.** Just like programming, [interviewing is muscle memory](https://medium.com/swlh/the-one-about-software-engineering-interviewing-6f126e3a3171). The key is to practice continuously. Keep a running list of stories you can talk through about your accomplishments. Continually update the resume. Practice the coding skillset with LeetCode or HackerRank. Do it weekly, even if it's just twenty minutes.

**Career capital can help.** Blogging, podcasting, and having open-source projects will help make your work shine. Crafting a professional social image is essential and may bring great conversation at an interview, but it is unnecessary to secure your next role. *If you have a portfolio, highlight it*! On occasion, it may help “stand out” with opportunities to interview.

**Find a long-term study buddy.** An excellent way to practice is to role-play. Find a study buddy. Real-time feedback goes a very long way. Meet weekly and rotate the interview formats from behavior/leadership to coding/system design. The most important use of time is to review the questions faced in an interview. Brainstorm together on how to formulate a better answer.

**There are different channels of feedback: external, internal, and role-play.** With each step in this ritual above, there are incoming learning notes. Whether you can clarify a question in your resume, update your LinkedIn profile, or had an impossible technical problem, review with a study buddy. Take these learnings and improve! 

**Connect with everyone you meet in your journey with kindness.** You will make connections along the way as you interview. Reach out to them, say thank you, and connect on LinkedIn or other methods. *Respect their process, no matter the outcome*. On occasion, new opportunities may arise, and your name may come up as being remembered as being a professional through the process.

**Interviewing is a hard skill to master.** Since the variables are infinite, there is no list to follow for the best outcome. The one takeaway is to be open to feedback and reflect on what you've learned. Preparation is essential, and the reflections are paramount as it's a campaign. If you keep these tips in mind, you're going to do great!
