## Quoting the Echo Effect.

[Remote work](https://dev.to/solidi/do-great-at-working-remotely-1oh9) has an indescribable quality of time travel. I'll joke with my friends that I've sat at my dining room table for days, but years have passed. So, as another cycle of the pandemic proceeded, I thought about my time in my seat. What I find interesting is my less-than-fluid interactions on remote calls. The [echo effect](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0261927X13506906), verbal mimicry increasing social likability, is in effect as the clock spins.

The words we speak on video calls are fascinating. My anxious behavior, genuinely attempting to connect through the void to others, is what is memorable. The small video box [doesn't deliver visual cues](https://dev.to/solidi/recognizing-remote-romantic-bibliophilia-255f), whereas the "tells" loudly define a culture. What do these words mean?

## What I'll Express

So, I took a handful of jargon I utter from time to time. Here is what my quotes convey.

"*8It looks like your battery is going to die.**" - I speak these words when I see a person's low-powered battery showing their near future demise. But maybe, the need for their self-care. They should take a short break.

"**Let me make a coffee, follow me.**" - When I feel the urge for caffeine and want to talk. Unlike in person, walking is absent in the virtual setting, losing another opportunity to forge a better relationship. So this is the best we can do.

"**If you cannot see my screen, shout out.**" - I've learned from the [annoying things](https://allwork.space/2020/10/remote-meetings-the-most-annoying-behaviors-and-phrases/) said in remote meetings, reversing asks with tells. I aim for courtesy, avoiding awkward waiting in a group setting.

"**Let's wait until we have a quorum.**" - Someone absent is essential to the meeting. I am conscious we are wasting other people's time. This meeting was [best as an email](https://medium.com/@solidi/reply-all-considered-harmful-f895beb5eabc) anyway. Sorry.

"**Doug is dropping lame jokes during a meeting.**" - If my jokes seem voluminous, it means I am in a good place today. I am looking for social interaction as there is lower stress. People who know my brand define these moments as "Dougisms."

"**I lost my connection.**" - I experienced a [disruption of my Internet connection](https://dev.to/solidi/cancel-this-app-update-dammit-5f6j) involuntarily. Sometimes, I lose it on purpose. I'm tired, needing a few minutes to regroup after receiving less than optimal information.

"**Let me take it on.**" - I am happy to take on a task for the team. I crave these straightforward [discernable tasks](https://dev.to/solidi/what-is-an-engineering-manager-anyway-4and). Completing this type of work is refreshing.

"**I'll give you back negative minutes.**" - I'll say this gem when we complete an extended one-on-one. My observation is we had a good conversation. The reality is I need to learn to stop talking, listen, and respect the fact I've made you late for the next meeting.

"**Here are the cheat codes to the side quest.**" - In private meetings, I often drop metaphors of comfort. Cheat codes suggest expectations for a given result, and side quests are long-running initiatives. They come from a vocabulary of [video games](https://solidi.substack.com/p/what-made-goldeneye-007-great) I enjoy.

"**I have a plot twist.**" - When the mission or initiative changes for the team. While the person who inspired me to use this phrase has moved on (and is an avid reader!), it remains a signal that the information I'll share is essential for all of us soon.

"**Gotta run.**" - My calendar is overflowing. Sorry, I have to leave. To the point, I need a break from the long marathon meetings today. I'll walk away from the table, seemingly unconscious from today's onslaught.

"**...**" - I'm busy with other priorities as my eyes dart around my screen, not looking at my camera. It's not acceptable I deprioritize you on this video chat. I swear it's essential, but I am disrespecting your time.

## Conclusion

These sayings constantly change over time, influencing the team's behaviors. The echo effect has quite a firm grasp on all interactions.

Where I go and who I interact with mark my behaviors over time, especially what I speak. And in a remote setting, the [words I say](https://medium.com/gitconnected/in-software-philosophy-is-delegation-c786dd3a16cf) seem hyper-focused, as sound is what is front and center.

What have you or someone said in a video conference recently? Do they have a specific meaning?
