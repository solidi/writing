# The One About Software Engineering Interviewing
## Mapping the Process after Years ofÂ Learning

I've recently reflected on my experiences as an interviewee in software engineering. As I trace through each interview, I have learned and improved.

I'd like to share these learnings with a diagram I've built from my last search and highlight the significant bits.

## Practice Role-Playing

My most impactful learning is discovering the value of practicing weekly with a friend. What I learned is that interviewing is a muscle. Finding a study buddy helped simulate [real interview situations](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-organize-your-thoughts-on-the-whiteboard-and-crush-your-technical-interview-b668de4e6941). This practice had a tangible improvement in offers. After securing a new job, we would continue to practice once a week for an hour to be sharp at interviewing, recalling professional stories.

## Partnering with Recruiting

I found success in partnering with recruiting as I went through the process. Being courteous, providing feedback, and asking what to expect had better outcomes. Being honest about my position in my search, expectations, and asking informed questions was an advantage.

## Optimal Months to Start aÂ Search

My personal interviewing experience revealed that searching during certain months increased job opportunities and responses. It became evident that the optimal range proceeded American Holidays where high paying companies advanced their talent searches. These months were January, April, and September.

## Feedback isÂ Rare

Interview loops do not provide direct feedback on performance Rejection was frequent, and my approach was to guess what had happened to improve. For example,â€Šif a story wasn't on the tip of my tongue, I thought about the situation and formulated an impactful answer.

## Questions ImproveÂ Profile

Since feedback is rare, each question asked was an opportunity to improve my professional profile. These include the resume, social profile, and other mediums. Each item found gaps in my profile that I did not highlight as an essential experience. By fortifying these gaps, I appeared comprehensive over time.

## Hydrating Skill Sets

Since [software engineering](https://dev.to/solidi/what-is-a-software-engineer-anyway-3fb2) contains many skill sets, technical questions are an opportunity to learn. If a technology came up where I did not have working experience, I would build cursory knowledge by setting aside time to learn.

## Expect Technical Variations

The technical interviews required knowledge of data types and operations. Importantly, some exercises were pair based, solving a problem together. Finally, I encountered three variations of system design. The three types included building something from requirements, debugging a mal-performing system, and talking through a system established by the team and discussing tradeoffs.

## Keep Interviewing

Interviewing is tough because you are being judged for a role. There were times where I'd disagreed with the outcome. There were times I completely bombed and felt humiliated days after the interview. On occasion, organizations have requested additional interviews with me! But by thinking objectively on performance and persevering through difficulty drove me to succeed. Keep at it! ðŸŽ‰

## Conclusion

My approach to finding the next opportunity is to understand the system [meta](https://medium.com/@solidi/the-many-senses-of-software-engineering-aba9f289498c). The result is the diagram above. By improving how I explained my experience concisely, I achieved offers.

While there is no formula to interview well, I hope this read will prepare you for your upcoming interviews.
